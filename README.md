# 📚 Python Programming Class

Welcome to the Data Seekho Programming Class repository! This repository contains code examples and explanations for various programming concepts across C++, Java, and Python. 🚀

## 📝 Overview
This repository serves as a practical guide to understanding basic programming concepts including variable assignment, error handling, and arithmetic operations in multiple programming languages.

## 💻 Programming Examples

### C++ Example
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Data Seekho" << endl; // Output a message
    return 0;
}
###Java Example

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Data Seekho"); // Output a message
    }
}
###Python Example

print("Data Seekho")  # Output a message


🗒️ Comments in Python
Single-Line Comments
Use # for single-line comments.


# This is a single-line comment
Multi-Line Comments
Use triple quotes """ or ''' for multi-line comments.


"""
This is a multi-line comment
It can span multiple lines
"""

⚠️ Types of Errors in Python
Errors in Python can be categorized into three main types:

Syntax Errors: Occur when incorrect syntax is used, preventing code execution.

print("Welcome to Data Seekho! Python Class"  # SyntaxError
Runtime Errors: Occur during execution, such as division by zero.

result = 10 / 0  # ZeroDivisionError
Logical Errors: Code runs without crashing but produces incorrect results.

Length = 10
Width = 2
area_of_rectangle = Length * Width  # Logic could be flawed

###📊 Basic Variable Assignment
Variables can be assigned different types:

age = 23  # Integer
height = 170.2  # Float
name = 'Sumanta'  # String
is_student = True  # Boolean

###➕ Basic Arithmetic Operations
You can perform basic arithmetic operations using standard operators:

# Addition
result = 2 + 3  # 5

# Subtraction
result = 5 - 1  # 4

# Multiplication
result = 4 * 6  # 24

# Division
result = 13 / 2  # 6.5

# Floor Division
result = 13 // 2  # 6

# Modulus
result = 13 % 2  # 1

# Exponentiation
result = 200 ** 2  # 40000

🔧 Using Built-in Functions
Python provides several built-in functions for working with numbers:

numbers = [10, 20, 5, 100, -50]
print(max(numbers))  # 100
print(min(numbers))  # -50

🔄 Type Conversion
You can convert between different numeric types using functions like int(), float(), and str().
