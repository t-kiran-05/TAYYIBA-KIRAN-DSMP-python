Exercise 1: Comments
# This program prints my name.(single line comment)
print("tayyiba kiran")  

#the program prints, whatever is written in it
#by the "print" statement, we can print a line or word, writen in quotes


Exercise 2: Identifying Errors
#Below is a piece of code with some intentional errors. Identify and correct the errors. Explain the type of error for each correction made.
#print("Welcome to Python!"
#result = 10 / 0               
#my_list = [1, 2, 3
#print(my_list[3])

# Corrected code with explanations:

#1.print("Welcome to Python!"
# SyntaxError: Missing closing parenthesis
print("Welcome to Python!")  # Added closing parenthesis

#result = 10 / 0   
# ZeroDivisionError: Division by zero is not allowed
# result = 10 / 0
result = 10 / 2  # Changed to divide by 2 instead of 0 to avoid the error

#my_list = [1, 2, 3
# SyntaxError: Missing closing square bracket for the list
my_list = [1, 2, 3]  # Added closing square bracket

#print(my_list[3])
# IndexError: List index out of range
# print(my_list[3])
print(my_list[2])  # Changed index to 2 to access the last element in the list


Exercise 3: Variable Assignment
# Assigning variables
name = "tayyiba kiran"
age = 2;p0  
height = 5  
is_student = True 

# Printing each variable with an appropriate message
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height)
print("Student status:", is_student)

Exercise 4: Descriptive Variable Names
# Using descriptive variable names
length = 5
width = 10
area = length * width
print("Area:", area)

Exercise 5: Numeric Types and Operations
# Adding two integers
result_add = 7 + 3
print("Addition result:", result_add)

# Subtracting a float from an integer
result_subtract = 10 - 4.5
print("Subtraction result:", result_subtract)

# Multiplying a float by a complex number
result_multiply = 3.5 * (2 + 3j)
print("Multiplication result:", result_multiply)

# Dividing an integer by zero (will produce an error)
try:
    result_divide = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Division error:", e)


#Exercise 6: Built-in Functions
# Taking a list of numbers as input from the user
user_input = input("Enter a list of numbers: ")
numbers = [float(num) for num in user_input.split(",")]

# Using abs(), max(), and min() functions
absolute_values = [abs(num) for num in numbers]
maximum_value = max(numbers)
minimum_value = min(numbers)

# Printing the results
print("Absolute values:", absolute_values)
print("Maximum value:", maximum_value)
print("Minimum value:", minimum_value)




Exercise 7: Arithmetic Operations
# Simple calculator program

# Prompting the user to enter two numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Asking the user to select an operation
print("Select an operation: + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division")
operation = input("Enter the operation: ")

# Performing the selected operation and printing the result
if operation == "+":
    result = num1 + num2
    print("Result:", result)
elif operation == "-":
    result = num1 - num2
    print("Result:", result)
elif operation == "*":
    result = num1 * num2
    print("Result:", result)
elif operation == "/":
    if num2 != 0:
        result = num1 / num2
        print("Result:", result)
    else:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
else:
    print("Invalid operation selected.")
